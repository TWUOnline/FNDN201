# Unit 5:  Do we find goodness in hospitality?

## Overview

In this unit, we will consider the meaning of hospitality from various contexts, including global and political, individual and spiritual. We will question what role hospitality may or may not play in experiencing the good life.

## Prompt 1:  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights

The Miriam-Webster Dictionary defines human rights as:

&quot;rights (such as freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution) regarded as belonging fundamentally to all persons&quot;

The Cambridge Dictionary explains human rights as:

&quot;the basic rights that it is generally considered all people should have, such as justice and the freedom to say what you think&quot;

What do human rights have to do with hospitality?  Well, it should be obvious that torturing and executing are not hospitable activities!  In this unit, you are invited to look at human rights more closely and consider the importance of the word &quot;all.&quot;

After considering a political perspective, you will take some time to examine scenes from Lewis&#39;s _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_. What does this literary work show you about individual hospitality? How is it related to goodness? How is it related to evil?

### Learning Activities

#### Activity 5.1: Greetings

View the images and read the short descriptions of [how people greet one another](https://www.opodo.co.uk/blog/greetings-around-the-world/) in various parts of the world.  Then watch the short video of [how one school principle greets students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0jgcyfC2r8) (1 minute).

#### Activity 5.2: Journal Reflection

Take approximately 5 minutes to journal your thoughts on the meaning of greetings and hospitality.

Next, contemplate the following questions:

- How do you define hospitality?
- What other concepts are related to hospitality?
- Greeting people and showing friendliness is one characteristic of hospitality. What are other contexts or situations where we hope to find hospitality?
- Do we find goodness in hospitality?

#### Activity 5.3: History of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights

Review the background information below.  This will help you understand the historical situation and the creation of _The Universal Declaration of Human Rights_.  Context is essential to analysis and interpretation, so don&#39;t skip this part!

**Background:**

In 1941, in the midst of the Second World War, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States, tried to convince the American people that they needed to support the war efforts as a means of also defending universal freedoms. On January 6, 1941, Roosevelt gave a speech known as &quot;The Four Freedoms,&quot; in which he argued for the freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. This speech became one of the underlying influences on the rise of The United Nations. See [https://fdrlibrary.org/four-freedoms](https://fdrlibrary.org/four-freedoms)

Figure 5.1 **[Note to find original source or replace with CC image]**

A time of immense global devastation through two world wars had recently come to an end. Civilians all around the world experienced losses and in Europe alone, there were an estimated 60 million displaced persons. People had little sense of security as they tried to rebuild their homes, livelihoods, and nations. The world became divided in the Eastern and Western blocs. It was in this context of instability that the United Nations came into existence in 1945 with the hope of preventing another war and working towards the betterment of human rights, of leading all nations to understand national hospitality: the fair and equal treatment of all people. See more on the history of the United Nations on their website: [http://www.un.org/en/sections/history/history-united-nations/](http://www.un.org/en/sections/history/history-united-nations/)

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on December 10, 1948 as a complement to the UN Charter.

**Writers:**

The Commission on Human Rights drafted the UDHR. It was made up of 18 members from various political, cultural and religious backgrounds. Here are some key individuals who played a major role:

- Chair, Eleanor Roosevelt, widow of American President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Eleanor Roosevelt is recognized as the driving force for the Declaration&#39;s adoption.)
- René Cassin of France composed the first draft of the Declaration
- Charles Malik of Lebanon was the Committee Rapporteur
- Peng Chung Chang of China was Vice-Chair
- John Humphrey of Canada was Director of the UN&#39;s Human Rights Division and prepared the Declaration&#39;s blueprint

**Important Concepts and Influences:**

The Declaration was adopted by the UN, but it was difficult to enforce and is now considered an aspirational document. The Principles of the UDHR include the following:

-
  - Rights of **universal and inalienable**
  - Rights are **interdependent and indivisible**
  - Rights are **equal and non-discriminatory**
  - We must respect **both rights** themselves (our own and the rights of others) **and obligations** to actively carry out rights.

For more on each of the sets of principles, see [What are Human Rights?](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Pages/WhatareHumanRights.aspx)

#### Activity 5.4: Read and Reflect

Read the preamble to [The Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/). Then skim over the 30 articles of the declaration. If you prefer an animated version, you can find numerous examples online, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTlrSYbCbHE).

Next, answer the following questions in your learning journal. Note that when you meet your group this week you may want to discuss your thoughts.

- What does the preamble suggest about the goals of the UDHR?
- As you read through the 30 articles:
  - What is meant by the right to \_\_\_\_\_?
  - How can \_\_\_\_\_\_ right strengthen communities?
  - How might \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ right challenge communities?
  - Is there a hierarchy of human rights?
  - What kind of obligations for states, individuals etc do human rights create?

Thinking about the UDHR &amp; Hospitality

- What are the connections between human rights and hospitality?
- Are there times when we are compelled to be hospitable regardless of people&#39;s rights?
- Are rights the source of human dignity?
- Do we find goodness in hospitality?
- What is the good life?

_Note that as with all of the first lesson prompts, you will_ **not be graded** _on these discussions. This prompt will help you explore the topics and will be instrumental in completing the final project._

## Prompt 2:  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe

Now let&#39;s consider a different take on hospitality.  In C.S. Lewis&#39;s classic children&#39;s novel, _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_, hospitality is one of the dominant themes. Set during World War II, when many families chose to evacuate their children from the cities of England to the countryside, four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) end up staying with &quot;The Professor,&quot; who opens his home for the children to take refuge from the bombings in London. The children discover a portal to another world called Narnia, where animals talk and beasts of all kinds enter into a good vs. evil battle. In Narnia, Mr. Tumnus (a mythical faun, half man and half goat) is hospitable to Lucy, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver offer hospitality to the children in their home, Father Christmas plays an interesting role, and The White Witch provides hospitality to Edmund. What do each of these situations show you about the meaning of hospitality? What is required for true hospitality? Is hospitality something that we _use_?  We will explore these questions as we look at excerpts from the story.

### Learning Activities

#### Activity 7: Background on Lewis and Narnia

Review the following background information on _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe._

**Clive Staples (C.S.) Lewis and Hospitality**

- Lewis was born in 1898 and grew up in a house with a lot of empty rooms and secret spaces where he used to play and hide as a child
- Became a Christian at age 32 after many discussions with friends at Oxford
- The Narnia stories explore the theme of good and evil, and hospitality is situated within this larger theme.
- Lewis was familiar with myths and ancient epics such as Homer&#39;s _Odyssey_.  In this long epic, it was imperative to welcome, feed, bathe, and provide for a stranger because that stranger could be a god or goddess.
- Lewis was also influenced by the biblical teaching on hospitality and welcoming the stranger.
- He believed in &quot;intellectual hospitality&quot; – listening to the opinions of others

**Context of Narnia**

- Narnia is the land of fantasy in the series of children&#39;s novels by C.S. Lewis
- _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ (1950) is second in the series and the most beloved.
- Set during WW II in England. The Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) are sent to the countryside to escape the bombing of London
- While the children are playing a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy hides in a large wardrobe and ends up walking right through it and into Narnia.

#### Activity 8: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe

View this slideshow **[link to Narnia slideshow]**of [excerpts](https://martzian.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/chronicles_of_narnia.pdf) from the novel.  If you have time, and if you have access, you can watch one of the film versions of the story (optional for Narnia fans).

## Assessment

### Group Discussion:

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, meet with your group to discuss the scenes we&#39;ve looked at in this unit and what they show you about the meaning(s) of hospitality, its relationship to good and evil, and how we can apply this to our understanding of &quot;the good life.&quot; Challenge yourself and your group members to look at this topic deeply. Complete the group template together and post the link to your Google Doc as a record of your group&#39;s discussion for Prompt 2.

### Inquiry Blog #2:

Take the hospitality challenge: open up your space, time, and mind to someone you don&#39;t normally host.  This could include inviting your dorm to your room for a snack or for a shared activity, inviting a classmate, dorm mate, or neighbour to go for a walk or for coffee, or any other invitation to spend time together. Remember that hospitality is not just giving someone food; it includes giving your full attention and listening ear and being willing to share of yourself. For your forum post, reflect on what this experience shows you about the good life.

OR

Read Jesus&#39; parable of The Good Samaritan in Luke 10:25-37.

You may have read or heard this story many times, and sometimes we can lose the impact after a while. Try to read this story again with fresh eyes to look for the meaning of hospitality. Reflect on what this parable teaches us about the good life.

## Unit 5 Summary

The Cambridge Dictionary says that hospitality is: &quot;the act of being friendly and welcoming to guests and visitors.&quot;  It seems like a simple concept – to invite someone to your home for a meal or take someone out for coffee. However, in this unit, we have taken this concept much further.  Hospitality requires that we first of all SEE other people, and once we see them, we determine how to treat them. Our prompts have shown us that it is not so simple, and I hope that you have been challenged in your discussions.  How does hospitality contribute to the good life? Does it? Can we have the good life without it?
